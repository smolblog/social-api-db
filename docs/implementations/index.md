# Implementations

Protocols and API standards are like ideas: there can be some very good ones, but even the best ones are useless unless
and until they are put into practice. So here's a list of projects and services that actually do the work of
implementing the protocols on this site.

Not every project here is going to implement a spec perfectly. Some of the specs on this site are intentionally vague
in order to maintain a level of flexability. When we list any deviations from the spec, we do so to help other
projects maintain compatability.

## Open Source Projects

These are complete projects you can download and run yourself without programming.

- WordPress
- [Mastodon](mastodon.md)

## Services

These services may or may not have a corresponding open source project, but they all implement at least one of the
open APIs on this site or enable an independent site to do so.

- [Micro.blog](microblog.md)

## Open Source Libraries

These are pieces of programs designed to help a project implment the protocols on this site.
